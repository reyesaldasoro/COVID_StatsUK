 Analysis of COVID Stats

These notebooks analyse the cases of Covid in the UK. There are several as the sources of data have been changing. The order in which I wrote them is the following:

* Covid Cases UK.ipynb 
* Analysis of Covid Cases UK.ipynb   (The data had changed, cases and deaths were available)
* Analysis of Covid Cases UK_2.ipynb (The data for deaths was no longer available)
