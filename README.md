 Analysis of COVID Stats

These notebooks analyse the cases of Covid in the UK. There are several as the  data has been changing, not only the temporal data, which could be expected, but the data related to deaths was removed from the source. The order in which I wrote them is the following:

* Covid Cases UK.ipynb
* Analysis of Covid Cases UK.ipynb   (The data had changed, cases and deaths were available)
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" width ="100" src="Figures\Deaths_UK_2020_08_10.png" alt="">

* Analysis of Covid Cases UK_2.ipynb (The data for deaths was no longer available Updated on the 2020/08/18)
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" width ="100" src="Figures\Coventry_Leicester_2020_08_17.png" alt="">


* **Analysis of Covid Cases UK_3.ipynb (Updated on the 2020/09/10)**
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" width ="100" src="Figures\Top_12_UK_Cases_2020_09_10.png" alt="">

* **AnalysisCovidCasesUK_4.ipynb (Updated on the 2020/09/16)**
<img vspace="5" hspace="5" width ="200" src="Figures\Map_UK_Cases_2020_09_16.png" alt="">

The latest one is the most up to date, but earlier ones show interesting differences.
